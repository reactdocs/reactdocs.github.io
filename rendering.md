# Rendering

> Rendering the process which puts the generated HTML from [JSX](./jsx.md) into DOM

In React/JSX environment HTML generated by JSX goes into DOM by using ReactDOM render function:

```javascript

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const injection = <p>New student</p>;
ReactDOM.render(
  injection,
  document.getElementById('appDiv')
);
```

> ```ReactDOM.render()``` is a method of ```ReactDOM``` imported from ```react-dom```.

> ```ReactDOM.render()``` takes 2 arguments, JSX and the DOM node where it will inject the HTML generated by JSX, respectively.

> Whole react app runs wrapped under the same root element.

> ```ReactDOM.render()``` is the only way for react to change DOM, however direct vanilla DOM manipulations are possible but they defy the purpose of react.

> ```ReactDOM.render()``` call is setup once and then react manages what to render internally based on UI interactions.
