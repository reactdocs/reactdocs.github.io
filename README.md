# React Introduction

## What is React?

> React is a JavaScript library for creating front end components that are user facing.

## Why to use React?

> React loads only changes making pages load faster.

React uses Virtual DOM to monitor changes and loads only changes to page DOM.

> React code is highly reusable.

React uses Components as the base unit of code which can be reused.
Think of a Component that displays image. Same component displays different images just input image url changes.

Also, React is available on multiple platforms like React Native for mobile apps, which also extends code reusablily to some extent.

> React code is declarative.

Looking at React code gives an robust view of data that a Component uses internally (State) and the inputs received from elsewhere (Props), if properly coded.
